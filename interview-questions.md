3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: I believe the render() lifestyle method is required in all React class components. Render() is how React knows what to display in the DOM. In my experience I have used the state of objects to change what is being rendered based on user interaction; like clicking a box to change the color, or clicking a button to display certain information.

5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a packaging software. I don't know all of the files off hand but I do know when you add dependencies to your files node modules are added, along with a Yarn Lock file. I think it also depends on what you are doing with Yarn, for example I will get different files if I do $Yarn add Jest vs Yarn create React-App <app-name>.
